name: branch-curator
description: Use whenever asked to audit, clean up, prune, delete, archive, or open pull requests for local Git branches or worktrees, especially in a multi-session repository. Trigger on "clean branches", "remove stale branches", "create PRs from local work", "prune worktrees", "sort out branches", or any request to decide which branches are live. Preserve uncertain work and require evidence before every mutation.

# Branch Curator
Curate branches without destroying another session's work. A branch name is only
one signal: files, claims, tasks, PRs, and recovery snapshots can all make it live.

## Core rule
Inventory first, classify every local branch, then act. Use read-only commands
against live or uncertain branches; make audit changes in a fresh worktree.

Never treat age, reachability, a missing worktree, or a missing PR as proof of
staleness. Do not mutate a candidate worktree until ownership is clear.

## What counts as live
Preserve a branch or worktree when any of these signals apply:
- It is checked out in any worktree and the owner has not confirmed it is idle.
- Its worktree has staged, unstaged, untracked, ignored, or dirty submodule state.
- `coven claim status`, a live claim file, or an active session names it.
- Any non-closed Bead names the branch, worktree, surface, or owner.
- It heads an open or draft pull request, or its CI is still running.
- It is a same-day backup, rescue, archive, or WIP snapshot without a disposition.
- Its tip or reflog changed in the last 24 hours without owner-authorized
  disposition. Recency is unconditional; known ownership does not override it.
- It contains local or remote commits whose disposition is not proven.
- Its local branch ref is symbolic rather than a direct commit ref.

Treat `main`, the default branch, Beads/Dolt sync refs such as
`__dolt_remote_info__`, and other tool-owned refs as protected infrastructure.

## Start with durable coordination
In a Beads repository:
```bash
bd prime
bd ready --json
bd list --limit 0 --include-gates --include-infra --include-templates --json |
  jq '[.[] | select(.status != "closed")]'
```
Claim one curation task before editing; never claim or close candidate-owning
tasks to ease cleanup. Record the curator branch, worktree, owner, and evidence.
Inspect all non-closed tasks because default `bd list` limits can hide ownership.

## Build the read-only inventory
Refresh remote-tracking refs, then collect all signals before deciding:
```bash
git fetch --no-prune origin
git status --short --branch
git worktree list --porcelain
git branch --merged origin/main --format='%(refname:short)'
git branch --no-merged origin/main --format='%(refname:short)'
```
Acquire branch names as data, not shell source. Refname rules make this an
unambiguous NUL stream after removing record newlines:
```bash
while IFS= read -r -d '' branch; do
  local_ref="refs/heads/$branch"
  printf 'branch=%q\n' "$branch"
  if symbolic_target=$(git symbolic-ref -q "$local_ref"); then
    printf 'PRESERVE - symbolic ref -> %s\n' "$symbolic_target"
    continue
  fi
  git show-ref --verify "$local_ref"
  git log -1 --format='committed=%cI%nsubject=%s' "$local_ref" --
  git reflog show --date=iso-strict --format='oid=%H selector=%gd' "$local_ref"
  git for-each-ref \
    --format='upstream=%(upstream:short)%ntrack=%(upstream:track)' \
    "$local_ref"
done < <(
  git for-each-ref --sort=-committerdate \
    --format='%(refname:lstrip=2)%00' refs/heads | tr -d '\n'
)
```
Do not parse displays back into commands; the loop variable is authoritative.
For every listed worktree, run:
```bash
git -C <worktree-path> \
  -c status.showUntrackedFiles=all \
  -c core.fileMode=true \
  -c core.fsmonitor=false \
  status --porcelain=v2 --branch --untracked-files=all \
  --ignored=matching --ignore-submodules=none
git -C <worktree-path> ls-files -v |
  awk '$1 ~ /^[a-z]/ || $1 == "S"'
```
This includes ignored paths. Also inspect `git -C <worktree-path> clean -ndx -d
-- .`. Preserve any staged, unstaged, untracked, ignored, dirty submodule,
assume-unchanged, or skip-worktree state unless policy explicitly declares an
ignored path disposable. Never let status, file-mode, or fsmonitor configuration
suppress this check.

Check runtime and task ownership:
```bash
coven claim status
coven sessions --json
primary_checkout=$(dirname "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)")
claims_file="$primary_checkout/.claude/claims.json"
test ! -f "$claims_file" || jq . "$claims_file"
bd list --limit 0 --include-gates --include-infra --include-templates --json |
  jq '[.[] | select(.status != "closed")]'
```
Run the documented live harness process/CWD check and map roots to worktrees.
Coven output supplements rather than replaces claims or process ownership.
Absence of a claim means "no claim found", not "no owner exists."

Fetch every PR once. Filter the exhaustive result by audited head OID to find
origin and fork PRs even when branch names differ:
```bash
pr_inventory_ok=1
if ! all_prs_json=$(
  gh api --paginate --slurp -X GET 'repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls' \
    -f state=all -f per_page=100
); then
  printf '%s\n' 'PRESERVE - PR inventory failed'
  pr_inventory_ok=0
fi
```
For each candidate, use the NUL-loop variable, capture both tips without
converting lookup failures into absence, and filter the PR inventory:
```bash
if test "$pr_inventory_ok" -ne 1; then
  printf '%s\n' 'PRESERVE - PR inventory unavailable'
  continue
fi

local_oid=$(git rev-parse --verify "$local_ref^{commit}")
remote_ref="refs/heads/$branch"
remote_oid=''
if remote_line=$(git ls-remote --exit-code --heads origin "$remote_ref"); then
  read -r remote_oid observed_remote_ref <<EOF
$remote_line
EOF
  test "$observed_remote_ref" = "$remote_ref" ||
    { printf 'PRESERVE - wrong remote ref\n'; continue; }
else
  remote_status=$?
  case "$remote_status" in
    2) remote_oid='' ;;
    *) printf 'PRESERVE - remote lookup failed (%s)\n' "$remote_status"; continue ;;
  esac
fi

matching_prs=$(
  printf '%s' "$all_prs_json" |
    jq --arg local_oid "$local_oid" \
       --arg remote_oid "$remote_oid" \
       '[.[][] | select(
          .head.sha == $local_oid or
          ($remote_oid != "" and .head.sha == $remote_oid)
        )]'
)
```
The workflow-runs API caps history at 1,000. Query each active status server-side
for every distinct audited OID; only existence matters, and OIDs survive aliases:
```bash
active_run_found=0
candidate_oids=("$local_oid")
if test -n "$remote_oid" && test "$remote_oid" != "$local_oid"; then
  candidate_oids+=("$remote_oid")
fi
for candidate_oid in "${candidate_oids[@]}"; do
  for run_status in queued in_progress requested waiting pending; do
    if ! run_json=$(
      gh api -X GET 'repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs' \
        -f per_page=1 -f "head_sha=$candidate_oid" -f "status=$run_status"
    ); then
      printf 'PRESERVE - Actions lookup failed for %s at %s\n' \
        "$run_status" "$candidate_oid"
      active_run_found=2
      break 2
    fi
    if test "$(printf '%s' "$run_json" | jq '.total_count')" -gt 0; then
      active_run_found=1
    fi
  done
done
```
An open matching PR or active workflow makes the branch live. Query failure
makes it uncertain.

For other candidates, inspect unique work using fully qualified refs:
```bash
local_ref="refs/heads/$branch"
main_ref='refs/remotes/origin/main'
git log --oneline --decorate --no-merges "$main_ref..$local_ref"
git diff --stat "$main_ref...$local_ref" --
git diff --name-status "$main_ref...$local_ref" --
git cherry -v "$main_ref" "$local_ref"
```
Do not use `eval`, parse names from displays, embed names in shell source, or use
unquoted interpolation. Git permits shell metacharacters in refnames. Use quoted
variables, fully qualified refs, and `--` before operands when supported.
Preserve a branch that cannot be handled safely.

## Classify every branch
Use exactly one decision for each local branch:
| Decision | Meaning | Allowed action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PRESERVE - live` | A worktree, claim, task, PR, CI run, or recent owner is active | Read-only inspection |
| `PRESERVE - recovery` | Backup, rescue, archive, or WIP snapshot still protects work | Keep and assign disposition follow-up |
| `PRESERVE - uncertain` | Ownership or unique-work evidence is incomplete | Keep and report missing evidence |
| `PR` | Scoped, complete, verified work has no current PR and is authorized for review | Open one PR |
| `DELETE` | Redundant work is proven safe to remove and cleanup is authorized | Remove only the proven refs |

If every branch is live, recovery, or uncertain, delete nothing and say so.

## Require an exclusive deletion gate
Read-only inventory and PR creation may run alongside other sessions. Ref or
worktree deletion may not. Final checks and deletion otherwise form a
check-then-act race: a new session, claim, task, PR, CI run, or dirty file can
appear without changing the audited branch OID.

Before classifying anything as `DELETE`, require a documented repository-wide
cleanup gate that:
1. quiesces every existing repository writer, including harnesses, worktrees,
   hooks, automation, and external clients;
2. prevents new sessions, claims, worktree writes, task ownership/status
   changes, PR creation/reopening, workflow dispatches, and other ownership or
   liveness transitions;
3. is respected by every supported harness, launcher, task system, Git host
   client, and workflow trigger;
4. has one auditable owner and bounded lifetime; and
5. remains held from the final ownership/state checks through all local and
   remote mutations and post-action verification.

A branch claim, Bead assignment, PID snapshot, advisory claim file, or verbal
"nobody is using it" does not provide exclusion. If the repository has no
enforced gate, preserve deletion candidates and report that cleanup is blocked
on an exclusive maintenance window. Do not invent a lock file that other tools
do not honor.

## Open a PR only for PR-shaped work
A branch is PR-shaped only when all of these are true:
1. Its purpose and owner are known, and opening a PR is authorized.
2. Its diff is scoped and coherent rather than a mixed backup or WIP snapshot.
3. The owning task's acceptance criteria are complete.
4. Relevant tests, lint, type checks, and repository gates pass.
5. It contains no secrets or local runtime state.
6. It is based on current `origin/main`, or any update was performed in its own
   isolated worktree with the owner's authority.
7. No existing open PR already uses the branch.
8. The owning writer is quiesced and an owner-held branch gate prevents local
   or remote tip changes and concurrent PR lifecycle changes through creation
   and head verification.

Do not open speculative PRs for backup branches, unowned work, incomplete task
branches, or branches that are still being edited. Link the PR in the owning
Bead and include verification evidence in the PR body.

Bind the PR to the commit that passed verification. While holding the branch
gate, capture `verified_oid` from the fully qualified local ref, query the exact
remote ref with the same failure handling used by the inventory, and require
the remote to be absent or already equal to `verified_oid`. Push a missing
remote only with an empty expected-value lease:

```bash
verified_oid=$(git rev-parse --verify "$local_ref^{commit}")
git push \
  --force-with-lease="$remote_ref:" \
  origin "$local_ref:$remote_ref"
```
Immediately re-read both OIDs and require exact equality before `gh pr create`.
Keep the gate held while creating the PR, then query the created PR and require
`.head.sha == verified_oid` before reporting success. If any OID advances,
lookup fails, or the gate cannot exclude concurrent writers, preserve the branch
and do not open or describe a PR as verified.
## Delete only after proof
Local deletion requires all of the following:
1. The branch is not protected or tool-owned.
2. No worktree is using it, or the known owner explicitly declared the clean
   worktree inactive.
3. Configuration-independent porcelain inspection shows no staged, unstaged,
   untracked, ignored, or dirty submodule state, except ignored paths that
   repository policy explicitly declares disposable.
4. `git symbolic-ref -q "$local_ref"` confirms it is not symbolic.
5. No live claim, active session, non-closed task, open PR, draft PR, or running
   CI owns it.
6. It is not an unresolved recovery snapshot.
7. Its tip and reflog are older than 24 hours, or the known owner explicitly
   authorized disposition after reviewing the current audited OIDs.
8. Cleanup is authorized and the repository-wide exclusive deletion gate is
   held.
9. Redundancy is proven by one of these routes:
   - every local and remote tip being deleted is an ancestor of `main_ref`; or
   - its PR is `MERGED`, every tip being deleted equals that PR's recorded head
     OID, and neither ref has advanced since merge.
10. Every branch and removable-worktree recovery OID is on refreshed main or an
    owner-authorized retained remote archive recorded in the owning Bead.
Capture local and remote tips before proving redundancy:
```bash
remote_ref="refs/heads/$branch"
audited_main_oid=$(git rev-parse --verify "$main_ref^{commit}")
audited_local_oid=$(git rev-parse --verify "$local_ref^{commit}")
audited_remote_oid=''
if remote_line=$(git ls-remote --exit-code --heads origin "$remote_ref"); then
  read -r audited_remote_oid observed_remote_ref <<EOF
$remote_line
EOF
  test "$observed_remote_ref" = "$remote_ref" ||
    { printf 'PRESERVE - wrong remote ref\n'; continue; }
else
  remote_status=$?
  case "$remote_status" in
    2) audited_remote_oid='' ;;
    *) printf 'PRESERVE - remote lookup failed (%s)\n' "$remote_status"; continue ;;
  esac
fi
```
For a merged PR, compare both captured OIDs to the API's `.head.sha`. For an
ancestry-based deletion, fetch the remote ref without moving the local branch,
then prove each captured OID is an ancestor:
```bash
git merge-base --is-ancestor "$audited_local_oid" "$audited_main_oid" ||
  { printf 'PRESERVE - local ancestry\n'; continue; }
if test -n "$audited_remote_oid"; then
  git fetch --no-prune --no-tags origin "$remote_ref" ||
    { printf 'PRESERVE - remote fetch\n'; continue; }
  fetched_remote_oid=$(git rev-parse --verify 'FETCH_HEAD^{commit}') ||
    { printf 'PRESERVE - remote object\n'; continue; }
  test "$fetched_remote_oid" = "$audited_remote_oid" ||
    { printf 'PRESERVE - remote moved\n'; continue; }
  git merge-base --is-ancestor "$audited_remote_oid" "$audited_main_oid" ||
    { printf 'PRESERVE - remote ancestry\n'; continue; }
fi
```
If any OID differs, is unavailable locally, or fails the chosen proof, preserve
the branch and inspect the divergence.
With the exclusive gate held, populate `authorized_archive_refs` only with full
owner-approved remote refs whose retention is recorded. Refresh the base and
resolve every archive to its exact current remote OID before proving every raw
record's old and new nonzero OIDs:
```bash
remote_main_ref='refs/heads/main'
main_line=$(git ls-remote --exit-code origin "$remote_main_ref") ||
  { printf 'PRESERVE - base lookup failed\n'; continue; }
read -r remote_main_oid observed_main_ref <<EOF

  { printf 'PRESERVE - fetched base mismatch\n'; continue; }

```
Still under the gate, query `remote_ref` again into `refreshed_remote_oid` with
the exact `ls-remote` failure handling above, fetch it, and require `FETCH_HEAD`
to equal it. Recapture the local OID; require both tips to equal their audited
OIDs, then rerun the exact guarded ancestry checks above or guarded equality
checks against the merged PR head using `audited_main_oid`. Any nonzero check
must immediately preserve. An unchanged lease cannot authorize divergence.
Before worktree removal, resolve `worktree_head_reflog` with `git -C
"$worktree_path" rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-path logs/HEAD` and run
the same raw old/new OID, numeric recency, and disposition proof against it.
Enumerate current per-worktree refs with:
```bash
git -C "$worktree_path" for-each-ref --format='%(objectname) %(refname)' \
  refs/bisect refs/rewritten refs/worktree
```
Prove every emitted OID and any reflog behind those refs the same way. Preserve
on unknown worktree-admin refs, malformed or missing HEAD reflog, or any failed
proof. Then repeat every ownership/state check and hold the gate through
mutation and final verification.
Remove only a clean, known-inactive worktree:
```bash
git worktree remove -- "$worktree_path"
```
Delete the local ref with Git's atomic compare-and-delete operation. It fails
instead of deleting if the branch advanced after the audit:
```bash
git update-ref --no-deref -d "$local_ref" "$audited_local_oid"
```
If a remote ref exists, delete it with an explicit lease bound to the captured
remote OID:
```bash
git push \
  --force-with-lease="$remote_ref:$audited_remote_oid" \
  origin ":$remote_ref"
```
Do not bypass `worktree-guard` merely to finish a sweep. A blocked deletion is
new evidence; return to classification unless the operator explicitly
authorizes the bypass after reviewing the recorded risk. Likewise, never use
`git update-ref -d` or a deletion refspec until every proof and immediate
recheck above has passed.
## Preserve at-risk work without touching its source
When unowned work needs a safety copy, leave the source worktree unchanged.
Create the snapshot from the source HEAD in a separate worktree, reproduce only
the observed diff, and verify file hashes before pushing a clearly named backup
branch. Do not open a PR for that snapshot. Record its source branch, base OID,
file list, verification, and intended owner or expiry in Beads.

Recovery branches are temporary safety artifacts, not a permanent coordination
system. Keep them until the owner accepts, lands, archives, or explicitly
discards the work.

## Verify the final state

After every action, re-run:

```bash
git worktree list --porcelain
git branch -vv --no-abbrev
```

Repeat the exhaustive per-branch PR and Actions API queries for every acted-on
branch. Also check `git status --short --branch` in every touched worktree.
Confirm each deleted local ref is absent and each deleted remote ref is absent
with:

```bash
if git show-ref --verify --quiet "$local_ref"; then
  printf '%s\n' 'verification failed: local ref still exists'
else
  local_status=$?
  test "$local_status" -eq 1 ||
    printf 'PRESERVE - local verification failed (%s)\n' "$local_status"
fi

if git ls-remote --exit-code --heads origin "$remote_ref"; then
  printf '%s\n' 'verification failed: remote ref still exists'
else
  remote_status=$?
  test "$remote_status" -eq 2 ||
    printf 'PRESERVE - remote verification failed (%s)\n' "$remote_status"
fi
```

Only status 1 from `show-ref` and status 2 from `ls-remote` prove absence.
Authentication, transport, server, and other failures are uncertainty, not
successful deletion. Confirm each created PR points at the expected head and
base.
## Report
Report every local branch, including protected and preserved entries:
| Branch | Live or recovery signals | Unique-work evidence | Decision | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
State PR links, refs removed, exact preservation reasons, untouched worktrees,
and curation Bead state. Call nothing stale or useless without the proof above.

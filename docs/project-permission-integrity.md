# Project permission integrity

## Why this exists

Project access is authorized by a registered project ID. Older local state can
contain direct grants, access-group grants, or pending proposals for a project
that has since been removed from the registry. Those records are no longer a
valid authority boundary and must not be silently treated as access.

## Detection and repair

`GET /api/project-grants` includes a read-only `integrity` report with counts
for stale direct grants, group grants, proposals, and their orphan project IDs.
The Chat → Projects screen presents a repair action only when that report is
non-empty.

Repair requires an explicit local human confirmation. `POST /api/project-grants`
with `{ "repairOrphans": true }` removes only records whose project ID is no
longer registered. It never creates a project, grants a permission, or changes
a valid record. The permission store writes a timestamped repair-audit entry,
so the operation is reviewable and safe to retry after interruption.

## Upgrade behavior

No startup migration runs automatically. On upgrade, existing permission data
is inspected without mutation. If stale records are present, an authorized
person can review the count in Projects and choose **Repair stale permissions**.
If no action is taken, server-side chat launch remains fail-closed: a session
still cannot start without an authorized, registered project root.

/**
 * The arcade panel — somewhere to put your hands during dead air.
 *
 * A voice call spends real seconds doing nothing you can watch: asking for the
 * mic, minting a session, connecting, and then waiting on the familiar to
 * think. This mounts Glitter Crypt into that gap.
 *
 * Three constraints shape it, and all three are load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. **Silent.** It plays *over* a live call, so the game never touches audio
 *    or `getUserMedia`. Enforced by an assertion in `glitter-crypt.test.ts`,
 *    not by good intentions.
 * 2. **Opt-in.** It never appears unasked. A game that ambushes someone
 *    mid-call is a bug, and the toggle is off until it is pressed.
 * 3. **Disposable.** All state lives inside the iframe, so unmounting is the
 *    entire teardown — no rAF loop or listener survives it.
 *
 * The iframe is `sandbox="allow-scripts"` with no `allow-same-origin`, so the
 * document sits on an opaque origin: it cannot reach our storage, cookies, or
 * DOM. That is why the game has to be one self-contained string.

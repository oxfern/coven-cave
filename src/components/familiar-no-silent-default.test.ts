// `familiars[0]` is whichever one happens to sort first, so defaulting to it
// silently assigns work, spends the wrong model's tokens, or (worst) changes
// the active familiar out from under the user.
//
// A default IS fine when it seeds a control the user can see and change. What
// this file pins is the consequential paths, where the answer must come from
// the user's own choice or from an explicit picker.

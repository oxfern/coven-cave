/**
 * use-deck-buckets — GitHub's own state for every pull request on the deck.
 *
 * The summary strip buckets each queue row, so it needs GitHub state for all of
 * them, not just the selected one. The full readiness fan-out is three requests
 * per pull request — far too many to spend across a queue against the
 * unauthenticated 60/hr budget. This hook reads one request each
 * (`/api/github/item?pull=1`), bounded by a cap and a small worker pool, the
 * same shape the activity route already uses for its CI enrichment.
 *
 * Rows past the cap, and rows still in flight, stay `unread` — the strip leaves
 * them out of its counts rather than guessing a bucket for a pull request it
 * has not read.

// Promote a session model to the familiar default (cave-pkapw).
//
// handleSelectModel sends scope = sessionId ? "session" : "familiar-default".
// So a brand-new chat's pick already becomes the familiar's durable default,
// while a pick INSIDE a session is session-scoped and leaves that default
// alone — "use this for every new chat" had no path from the composer, only
// from Home or the Familiar studio.
//
// The two things worth pinning are the ones that could silently rot: the scope
// it sends (wrong scope = writes the wrong record) and when the row is offered
// (always-on = a no-op action users learn to ignore).

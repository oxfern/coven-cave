// src/app/api/x/ behind entirely. Both surfaces rendered unconditionally, so
// every fetch 404'd and each showed a permanent ErrorState — a section that

//
// These pins hold the gate in place. They are deliberately cheap to satisfy
// and cheap to DELETE: when the routes land, removing the conditions makes
// these fail, which is the prompt to remove the pins too.

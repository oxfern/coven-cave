/**
 * Hermes API settings — where the structured-transport endpoint and key come
 * from, and who wins when more than one source has an opinion.
 *
 * Cave's chat route already knew how to USE `HERMES_API_URL` /
 * `HERMES_API_KEY`; it had no way to SET them. The values could only arrive as
 * ambient process env or a hand-written vault entry, while the in-chat notice
 * cheerfully told operators to "configure" them. This module is the seam that
 * makes that instruction actionable.
 *
 * Split of storage, deliberately:
 *
 *   - The **endpoint** is not a secret. It lives on the familiar's binding in
 *     cave config, so the settings UI can read it back, show it, and let it be
 *     edited — a write-only endpoint field would be unusable.
 *   - The **key** IS a secret. It lives in the vault, scoped to the familiar,
 *     and is never read back to any client. `harnessSpawnEnv(familiarId)`
 *     already subtracts vault keys the familiar isn't granted, so scoping the
 *     key is what keeps one familiar's Hermes credential out of another's
 *     spawn environment.
 *
 * Both halves converge here into the env pair `hermesApiConfig()` expects, so
 * the send route and the model-state route resolve identically and a setting
 * can never be honoured on one path and ignored on the other.

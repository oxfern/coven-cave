 * Frecency for project pickers (cave-ow9f).

 * Pickers order alphabetically, which is stable but never learns: the project
 * you open twenty times a day sits wherever the alphabet put it. Frecency
 * ranks by how often AND how recently you picked something, so the answer
 * rises without the list becoming unpredictable.
 *
 * The ordering contract deliberately does NOT re-sort the whole list. A list
 * that reorders under the cursor is worse than one that never learns — you
 * reach for the third row and it has moved. Instead a capped Recent section
 * pins on top and the full A-Z list stays exactly where it was underneath.
 * (The bead's own tradeoff note asks for this.)
 *
 * Keyed by normalized project ROOT, not id: a project re-registered under a
 * new id at the same path is the same project to the person picking it.

/**
 * Run-history ownership + forge-resistance model (issue #3470).
 *
 * Flow and workflow run records back the run-history UI and any automation
 * that keys off run status. To keep that history trustworthy the mutating
 * routes (POST/PATCH/DELETE) enforce a single, shared model:
 *
 * 1. OWNERSHIP. Run records are executor/daemon owned in production. The
 *    daemon is the authoritative writer of production status transitions and
  *    it presents the first-party sidecar token, so only a request that passes
  *    `isLocalOrigin` may claim `source: "daemon"` (this implicitly requires the
  *    token when `COVEN_CAVE_AUTH_TOKEN` is configured). Mobile/tailnet callers
  *    are always pinned to `source: "cave"`. Client POSTs remain allowed for editor preview / dry-run
  *    snapshots, but they cannot forge daemon provenance.
 *    snapshots, but they cannot forge daemon provenance.
 *
 * 2. DESKTOP-ONLY MUTATION. All mutators are gated by `isLocalOrigin`, which
 *    rejects mobile/tailnet requests even when the Host header is spoofed to
 *    loopback. Reads (GET) stay open so the iOS app can render history.
 *
 * 3. BOUNDED STEPS. Step arrays are capped by count and serialized bytes so a
 *    single forged/oversized run cannot balloon the store (DoS footgun).
 *
 * 4. SAFE WIPE. A full history wipe requires an explicit `?all=1` flag;
 *    scoped deletes by flow/workflow id do not. This prevents an accidental
 *    "delete everything" from a bare DELETE.
 *
 * Both route families import from here so their guards stay in lockstep.

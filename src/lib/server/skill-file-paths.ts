/**
 * Allow-list for the Capabilities skill-preview reader (/api/skills/file).
 *
 * Skills surface in the Capabilities map with an on-disk `path` (a SKILL.md, or
 * a harness instructions file like CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md). To render that file
 * as styled markdown we read it server-side from a user-supplied path, so the
 * path MUST be constrained to the well-known harness/skill roots under $HOME —
 * otherwise the route is an arbitrary-file-read primitive.
 *
 * The guard rejects symlinks, resolves both the candidate and root through the
 * filesystem, and only allows expected instruction/skill filenames. This keeps
 * the preview endpoint from exposing arbitrary markdown or symlink targets from
 * broad harness directories.

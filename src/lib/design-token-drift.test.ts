// Design-token drift gate — Cave UX P3 (Sage's 2026-07-03 audit).
//
// The design-language shipping checklist (docs/coven-design-language.md §9,
// rule 1) is "tokens only — no hardcoded colors, radii, or font sizes". This
// gate keeps that contract enforceable in two tiers:
//
//   1. ZERO TOLERANCE for on-scale literals: running the codemod
//      (scripts/codemods/tokenize-css.mjs) over every in-scope CSS file must
//      be a no-op. A `font-size: 12px` that should be `var(--text-sm)` fails
//      here — fix by running:  node scripts/codemods/tokenize-css.mjs
//
//   2. RATCHETS for the judgment categories (off-scale px values, hex colors
//      outside token definitions, inline TSX style objects). These can only
//      go DOWN. If you add one deliberately (e.g. a genuinely dynamic inline
//      style), lower-or-equal is enforced — raise the baseline in the same
//      PR and say why. When you reduce drift, lower the baseline to bank it.
//
// The codemod's px→token tables are pinned against the live definitions in
// src/app/globals.css, so a token retune fails loudly instead of letting the
// codemod silently rewrite to stale values.
//
// RUN THIS FILE WITHOUT THE CSS FACADE HOOK. This gate measures the PHYSICAL
// CSS tree, so scripts/run-tests.mjs deliberately runs it without
// `--require ./scripts/css-source-contract-hook.cjs` (RAW_SOURCE_SCANNER_TESTS).
// Under the hook — the incantation every OTHER source-contract test wants —
// fs.readFileSync inlines import facades and every imported sheet is counted
// twice, inflating the ratchets ~1.6x into convincing but bogus "went UP"
// failures. The guard below fails fast instead (cave-d1a0p).

// and every number this gate would produce is wrong.

const BASELINES = {
  offScaleFontSizePx: 139, // -2: banked — the familiar-analytics workbench rebuild ("Familiar Analytics.dc.html" handoff, cave-l4ttp) ships every size in the new sheet on the type scale, and retiring the old scrolling page's hero/KPI/section chrome reclaimed two off-scale sizes outright. -5: banked — the GitHub triage stream + detail rebuild ("Cody Github.dc.html" handoff) ships every size in both new sheets on the type scale, and retiring the table + the old glass masthead reclaimed their off-scale sizes outright. // -5: banked — the GitHub card composer ("Final Card Components.dc.html" handoff, cave-076kh) ships fully on the type scale, and rebasing onto current main reclaimed the rest. +1: chat session redesign (Chat.dc.html 2a) — the assistant turn's serif familiar name keeps the design's 18px step, between --text-lg 16px and --text-xl 20px; every other size in the new session-chrome sheet is on the type scale (the new-session hero uses a clamp off the display size). 10.5px/11.5px/… — need per-case renormalization to the type scale (banked: canvas-editor.css on the type scale; familiar-tab retokenized the old hero/section styles; research-desk tabs shipped fully on the type scale, -3; familiar-tab five-section rebuild shipped fully on the type scale, -1; projects access page rebuild shipped fully on the type scale, -2). +1: Research Reader (Research Reader.dc.html handoff) — the EB Garamond findings hero <h1> keeps the design's 31px display size (between --text-display 28px and the next step); every other reader font-size uses the type scale and compact mono labels use the `font:` shorthand. -3: orphaned skill-browser removal reclaimed its off-scale sizes. -2: Phone control-sheet extraction replaced the legacy block with section-local tokenized CSS.
  offScaleSpacingPx: 1654, // +1: live call transcript (cave-zr9dx) — the spoken-word highlight's `padding: 0 2px`. The <mark> tints the words the familiar is voicing INSIDE a turn bubble that is already tinted, so the run needs a hair of inline padding or the tint touches the glyphs on both sides; --space-1 (4px) at that scale reads as a gap in the sentence, which is the one thing a mid-sentence highlight must not do. Same micro-mark family the Chart Room, Weaves, Review Deck and GitHub-composer handoffs banked. Every other spacing value the call overlay added — 5 gaps, 3 paddings and the reply form's stack — snapped to --space-1/-2/-3 in this PR, so the sheet went +1 rather than the +11 it started at. // -65: banked — the familiar-analytics workbench rebuild (cave-l4ttp) snapped the mock's 5/6/7/9/10/11/13/14/15/18/22/26px paddings and gaps to --space-1..-6 across the whole new sheet, and retiring the old page's section/KPI/hero chrome reclaimed the rest. What remains in the sheet is only the 1/2/3px micro-mark family (badge padding, tick nudges) the earlier handoffs already banked. +4: GitHub triage stream + detail rebuild ("Cody Github.dc.html" handoff) — the mock's 5/7/9/10/11/13/14px paddings and gaps were ALL snapped to --space-1..-4 in this PR, so what remains is only the micro-mark family the Chart Room, Weaves, Review Deck and GitHub-composer handoffs already banked: 6px glyph-to-label gaps (8px separates an icon from its word, which is exactly what a stage badge, a signal chip and a gate label must not do), 6px inline padding on the 17-19px stage badges and row verbs (--space-2 turns a 17px pill into a lozenge), and the 2/3px nudges on the signal strip, the peek margin and the facts column. Retiring the table and the old glass masthead reclaimed most of what the two new sheets added, which is why this is +4 rather than the +40 they started at; every font-size in both sheets is on the type scale (-5 banked above) and tokenize-css.mjs is a no-op over them.
  offScaleRadiusPx: 233, // +1: GitHub triage stream ("Cody Github.dc.html" handoff) — the row's three-segment signal strip paints 4px-wide bars, and a 1px radius is the only step that reads as a rounded mark rather than a lozenge; --radius-sm turns a 4px bar into a dot. Same short-solid-mark family the research-desk, Research Reader, daily-report and Rituals-sparkline entries banked. The strip's 2px track/fill radii reuse the existing budget-meter step, every container corner in the new stream and detail sheets uses --radius-sm/-md/-lg/-control/-pill/-panel, and both sheets went DOWN on spacing and font-size in the same PR. // -2: banked after the chat-detail merge removed two off-step radii. +4: Chart Room v2 (cave-iuc8h) — the 2px project dot and its 3px large variant, plus the 2px progress track and its fill: short solid marks 6-10px across, the same family the research-desk, Research Reader, daily-report, Projects and GitHub-composer handoffs banked (--radius-control 8px reads as a full circle at that size, which is the one shape a square project swatch must not be). Every container corner in the sheet uses --radius-sm/-md/-control/-pill, and the dependency port is a true 50% circle. // +6: chat session redesign (Chat.dc.html 2a/2b) — the context row's 6px mono chip and 4px stat cell, the group headers' 4px count pills and the rail row's 2px state tick: short compact marks between --radius-control 8px and square. Every container corner uses --radius-card/--radius-panel/--radius-pill. 4px/6px/10px/14px/… radii between the sanctioned steps. +5: research-desk 2px/4px accent-mark radii (short solid marks, not container corners). -5: projects access page rebuild removed the hub's off-step radii. +1: Research Reader accent-mark radius (the section-heading 2px tick, same short-solid-mark family as the research desk). -3: orphaned skill-browser removal reclaimed its off-step radii. -3: Phone control-sheet extraction replaced the legacy block with section-local tokenized CSS. +8: daily report redesign (2a handoff) — the chaptered-day surface's 1/2/3/4px radii on short solid marks (week-strip activity bars, streak pips, swimlane segments and merge ticks, the spine's accent rail), the same short-mark family the research-desk and Research Reader handoffs banked; every container corner snapped to --radius-control/-card/-panel/-sm in the same PR. -2: Canvas page redesign (Canvas.dc.html handoff) — the gallery card's 10px corner and the inspector swatch's `50%` circle snapped to --radius-card and --radius-pill. +3: Projects access refresh — the 5px radius on the card select-checkbox (17px) and the two 18px icon buttons (disclose, gear); --radius-control (8px) reads as a circle at those sizes. Every container corner in the new sheet uses --radius-control/-card/-pill. +1: the Rituals inbox daily-report row's 24-bar merge sparkline, same short-solid-mark family (a 3px-wide bar cannot take a scale radius). +8: GitHub card composer (cave-076kh) — the composer's 4px chips (reactions, assignee/label chips, gate-row actions, scope chips, toolbar buttons) and 3px segment thumbs (Write/Preview, merge method, verb mode), the same short-compact-mark family the research-desk, Research Reader, daily-report and Projects handoffs banked; --radius-control (8px) reads as a pill at a 19-22px chip height. Every control corner uses --radius-sm (the design's own "5-6px control" band) and every container --radius-control/--radius-pill.
  hexOutsideDefinitions: 0, // hex in render CSS (token definitions excluded) — -104: cave-gyh2 chunk 1 (dropped stale var(--token, #hex) fallbacks; mapped accent/danger/success fills to their semantic foregrounds; promoted --color-success-foreground and the codex --cv-* strays). -1 banked in the design-doc reconcile PR (cave-kf3x). -51: cave-yxiz chunk 2 zeroed the ratchet — document grounds (sketch/preview/thumb/QR) now share the fixed --surface-paper token in foundations.css; GitHub state badges promote --gh-merged/--gh-merged-ink and pair open/closed with the semantic status foregrounds; profile-card strays joined the --pfc-* palette; the magic-cast spell art promotes --spell-violet/--spell-core; QR ink, dashboard mark ink, and the avatar photo-overlay ink became local definitions; and pure shade/alpha arithmetic in color-mix()/mask gradients uses the CSS black/white keywords (sanctioned: they're mix anchors, not colors — matching the pre-existing keyword usage in dashboard.css and surface-compact-calendar.css). New hexes belong in token definitions; keywords are only for mix/mask arithmetic.
  inlineTsxStyles: 207, // +5: familiar-analytics workbench rebuild (cave-l4ttp) — every one paints a live percentage that only exists at render time: the four 0-100 thread-metric bars (analysis panel + trust modal), the per-report score bar in the report ledger, the self-heal severity meter, and the expanded pulse's per-day bar height (a day's count as a share of the window's peak). All are model-derived from self-reports and session counts, so no token can express them; track, radius, colour and motion are all CSS. Three avoidable sites went the other way in the same PR — the renown meter now carries ONE --fa-renown-pct that its fill, sheen and quarter-tick gradient all read, and the contract pass/fail split sizes its two segments from --fa-pass/--fa-fail instead of two inline flex-grows. // +3 on top of main's 199: Expand reader (Reader.dc.html 3a, cave-zhmto) — both carry a value that only exists at render time. The progress hairline paints `scaleX(<fraction of the answer scrolled>)`, read off the scroll container every frame; a token cannot express "how far down this reader is". The rail entry paints `--reader-depth` = the heading's level minus the answer's own shallowest level, so an answer written entirely in `##` is not uniformly indented — the indent step itself IS a token (--space-3), only the multiplier is per-answer. The third is the footer's by-tool share bar, whose fill width is that tool's measured fraction of the turn's wall time — read off the turn's own ToolEvent durations, so it exists only once the turn has run. Every other value in the reader is a class in cave-chat/reader.css; the sheet added no off-scale spacing or radius (both ratchets held at baseline in this PR). // +1: chat context breakdown bar (a232c9d63) — each segment's `width` is that row's share of the context window, clamped 0-100 from live token counts; the value only exists at render time from model state, so there is no token that could express it. +1: thread-instruments stamp lane (cave-xb6g5) — the spine hands the stylesheet `--cave-spine-stamp-chars`, the length of the longest clock string it is about to render. That is the reader's own locale and clock format (24-hour "23:00" is 5, 12-hour "11:00 PM" is 8), so it is unknowable at author time and cannot be a token; a fixed value clips timestamps on any machine whose clock is wider than ours, which is the exact bug the lane was added to end. +1: Review Deck summary strip (cave-d9nta) — the bucket bar's fill paints each bucket's computed share of the deck through a `--rd-share` custom property; the percentage is derived from live GitHub state, so it cannot be a token. +8: thread instruments (cave-j86la) — every one is a measured or model-computed value, not presentation: the spine's per-node `top` and line height come from live turn-offset measurement, its stack height/segment heights are proportional to the turn's tool counts, and the minimap's pane height, caret `top`, per-event bar width/height and the shared hover card's row-anchored `top` are pane-measure + model-derived. +2: the context row's context-window meter paints a computed percentage width — a genuinely dynamic value, not presentation. style={{…}} in TSX; many are legit dynamic values (banked from 500 — the count had drifted far below the old ceiling; -2: projects access page rebuild dropped the hub's inline styles; +1: vendored Blaze.tsx canvas host uses dynamic style spread for WebGL positioning; +1: vendored Peel.tsx canvas host for page-peel reveal effect uses runtime-mutated inline styles; +2: project-setup modal color swatches paint runtime-only values (per-root tint + oklch palette choice); -1: orphaned skill-browser removal dropped its inline style; -45: Phone extraction moved static presentation out of settings-shell.tsx; -1 net: the daily report redesign retired daily-report-ui.tsx and shipped-table.tsx, and its own new inline styles are dynamic-only — CSS custom properties carrying computed percentages and the model's semantic tone; -1 more when the shipped rows' external links became in-app buttons opening the app's GitHub card; -3 net against the declared baseline after rebasing: one concurrent reduction banked, and two GitHub task-status dots moved from token-valued inline styles to state classes) +5: Chart Room v2 (cave-iuc8h) — every one carries a computed value into CSS through a custom property, never presentation: the chain diagram's per-node x/y from the connected-component layout, the gantt bar's left/width from dependency depth and its fill from the card's real project colour, the table's per-column width, and the help grid's column count from the measured breakpoint. The room's flow, graph and orchestration lanes do the same through multi-line style props; all of them are layout measured at runtime or colour read from board data, so none can be a token. // +1: Review Deck summary strip (cave-d9nta) — the bucket bar's fill paints each bucket's computed share of the deck through a `--rd-share` custom property; the percentage is derived from live GitHub state, so it cannot be a token. +8: thread instruments (cave-j86la) — every one is a measured or model-computed value, not presentation: the spine's per-node `top` and line height come from live turn-offset measurement, its stack height/segment heights are proportional to the turn's tool counts, and the minimap's pane height, caret `top`, per-event bar width/height and the shared hover card's row-anchored `top` are pane-measure + model-derived. +2: the context row's context-window meter paints a computed percentage width — a genuinely dynamic value, not presentation. style={{…}} in TSX; many are legit dynamic values (banked from 500 — the count had drifted far below the old ceiling; -2: projects access page rebuild dropped the hub's inline styles; +1: vendored Blaze.tsx canvas host uses dynamic style spread for WebGL positioning; +1: vendored Peel.tsx canvas host for page-peel reveal effect uses runtime-mutated inline styles; +2: project-setup modal color swatches paint runtime-only values (per-root tint + oklch palette choice); -1: orphaned skill-browser removal dropped its inline style; -45: Phone extraction moved static presentation out of settings-shell.tsx; -1 net: the daily report redesign retired daily-report-ui.tsx and shipped-table.tsx, and its own new inline styles are dynamic-only — CSS custom properties carrying computed percentages and the model's semantic tone; -1 more when the shipped rows' external links became in-app buttons opening the app's GitHub card; -3 net against the declared baseline after rebasing: one concurrent reduction banked, and two GitHub task-status dots moved from token-valued inline styles to state classes) // +1: Thread Signal triage card (cave-vkegj) — the rationale strip's fill paints the selected metric's score as a percentage width. The value is a familiar's self-reported 0-100 for whichever tile the reader just tapped, so it exists only at render time and no token can express it; the bar's track, radius, colour and transition are all CSS. Same dynamic-percentage family as the context breakdown bar and the Review Deck bucket bar below. // +1: chat context breakdown bar (a232c9d63) — each segment's `width` is that row's share of the context window, clamped 0-100 from live token counts; the value only exists at render time from model state, so there is no token that could express it. +1: thread-instruments stamp lane (cave-xb6g5) — the spine hands the stylesheet `--cave-spine-stamp-chars`, the length of the longest clock string it is about to render.

/**
 * Coding Room keyboard shortcuts (cave-uod42).
 *
 * The Room's approved design asks for five bindings — focus next terminal,
 * split right, split down, close pane, toggle broadcast — and adds one hard
 * constraint: "Shortcuts do not fire from text inputs outside xterm."
 *
 * Why a pure resolver rather than an inline keydown block: the Room's center is
 * a terminal, so the cost of getting a combo wrong is a keystroke silently
 * eaten from a running shell. Keeping the mapping data lets a test enumerate
 * every combo and assert the negatives — plain letters, bare Ctrl, and typing
 * targets — which is the half that a hand-rolled handler never covers.
 *
 * Modifier choice: every binding is Cmd/Ctrl **plus Shift**. Bare Ctrl+letter
 * is shell signal territory (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D) and Alt+letter is an escape
 * sequence, so both would collide with the surface these shortcuts control.
 * Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+letter emits nothing on any terminal transport we ship, and
 * no ⇧⌘ combo exists anywhere else in the app's catalog.

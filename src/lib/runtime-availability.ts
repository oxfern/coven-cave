 * `coven run` (the default for codex/claude/…), or the copilot / grok /
 * hermes / opencode CLIs. "Available" here means one thing only: the EXACT
 * command the route is about to hand to `spawn()`, resolved inside the EXACT
 * environment that spawn will receive, points at a real launchable file.
 *
 * The evaluation is bounded and passive — filesystem metadata and permission
 * checks only. It never spawns a process, never prompts, and never touches the
 * user's message, so it is safe to run before every chat turn.
 * Authentication/provider health is deliberately out of scope: a runner that
 * launches but is signed out is "ready" here and must fail through its own
 * real output.

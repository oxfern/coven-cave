/**
 * familiar-types — the Cave's explicit familiar Type vocabulary (cave-cc5r).
 *
 * A familiar's *type* is an explicit, user-modifiable vocation that unlocks
 * Role Surface rooms — the same matching machinery the free-text Role label
 * feeds, made visible and deliberate. Each type grants one role token; the
 * room registry (role-surfaces.ts) matches surfaces against the combined set,
 * so types ADD grants and never subtract what a role label already gives.
 *
 * The stored `familiarType` field is a comma-separated list of type ids
 * (e.g. `"coding,research"`). General is the empty state and never appears
 * as a member. Role grants are the union across all selected types.
 *
 * The table is static on purpose: it is the single documented mapping from
 * "what the user picks in Familiar Studio → Identity" to "which room opens",
 * unit-testable without the component registry.
 *
 * The vocabulary is deliberately small (cave-lgcb): usage evidence trimmed
 * it from nine types to this core set. Retired ids stay resolvable through
 * RETIRED_FAMILIAR_TYPE_SUCCESSORS, and their rooms remain reachable via
 * free-text Role labels and registry aliases.

/**
 * `/auto` mission state — the per-session record that makes an autonomous
 * mission survive a reload, stay scoped to the chat it was started in, and
 * disarm once it terminates.
 *
 * Why this exists rather than plain React state: the whole promise of /auto
 * is an UNATTENDED run. The user starts a mission and walks away — closing,
 * reloading, or switching chats is the expected case, not the edge case. A
 * mission held only in component state loses its arming on the first reload,
 * so the completion ping (the one thing the feature exists to deliver) never
 * fires. Persisting also carries the already-notified turn ids, so a reload
 * that re-reads the transcript can't re-ping for a turn already announced.
 *
 * Pure helpers with injected storage (chat-archive-nudge.ts convention) so
 * the whole decision path is testable under `node --test` with no DOM.

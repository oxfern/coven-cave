// Source pins for cave-2cpo — thread-snapshot write durability on iOS.
//
// PR #3456 shipped the debounced persistence but merged with both review
// threads unresolved, leaving two defects that are invisible to CI because
// apps/ios is not compiled by any required check:
//
//   1. flushThreads() spawned an UNTRACKED Task.detached, so a newer flush
//      could not supersede a stale in-flight write. ThreadSnapshotStore is an
//      actor — writes never interleave — but actors make no FIFO promise, so
//      the OLDER snapshot could resume last and overwrite newer state.
//   2. flushThreads() was documented and used as a SYNCHRONOUS lifecycle flush
//      from the scenePhase handler, but returned the instant the task was
//      spawned, so suspension could freeze the process before the bytes landed.
//
// These pin the contract rather than the implementation: a tracked write, a
// chained (ordered) write, an awaitable flush, and a lifecycle caller that
// actually waits while holding background time.

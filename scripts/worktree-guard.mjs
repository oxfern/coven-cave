/**
 * worktree-guard.mjs — PreToolUse hook (matcher: Bash) that blocks the
 * destructive-op class of cross-session damage (docs/multi-session-coordination.md §5).
 *
 * Incident that prompted this (2026-07-03): an actor pushed another session's
 * in-progress branch, merged it as PR #2290, then ran the standard post-merge
 * cleanup — `git worktree remove` + `git branch -D` — destroying the owning
 * session's worktree mid-edit. Every uncommitted change was lost. The same husk
 * pattern (worktree gutted while a dev server / tsc still ran inside it) had
 * already hit `.worktrees/library-worldclass-ux` and `.worktrees/split-collapse-*`.
 * A sibling incident (#2286) chained `git push origin --delete` after a FAILED
 * merge, which auto-closed the still-open PR.
 *
 * Unlike surface-claim-guard (advisory), this hook BLOCKS (exit 2) — these ops
 * destroy unrecoverable state, and every blocked case is either a mistake or a
 * one-keystroke bypass away:
 *
 *   • `git worktree remove <path>` / `rm -rf .worktrees/<name>` (the worktree
 *     ROOT, not paths inside it) is blocked when the worktree is DIRTY or its
 *     HEAD exists on no remote ref — i.e. destruction would orphan real work.
 *     Husk dirs (no .git link) and clean+pushed worktrees pass silently, so
 *     post-merge cleanup and husk GC stay frictionless.
 *   • `git branch -D <name>` is blocked when the branch tip is not contained in
 *     any remote-tracking ref (deleting it would orphan unpushed commits).
 *   • `git push <remote> --delete <branch>` (or `push <remote> :<branch>`) is
 *     blocked when an OPEN PR still has that head (deleting the branch closes
 *     the PR — the #2286 failure). Needs `gh` + network; fails OPEN.
 *   • `mv .worktrees/<name> <elsewhere>` is blocked on the same risk test:
 *     git's admin file keeps pointing at the old path, so moving a live
 *     worktree strands its work exactly like deleting it would.
 *
 * "Retained" means a remote BRANCH or a TAG that is present on a remote. Tags
 * count because archiving a branch as a signed, pushed tag preserves its OIDs
 * more durably than a branch does — merging deletes the branch, never the tag.
 * Requiring a branch made the guard block six provably-archived cleanups during
 * one sweep (2026-07-29), and six bypasses to delete preserved work is how the
 * bypass stops being read. A LOCAL-only tag never counts: it dies with the
 * machine. Verifying a tag is remote needs the network (git keeps no
 * remote-tracking refs for tags), and that probe fails CLOSED — unlike the
 * warn-only probes here, it gates deletion, so "cannot verify" must not read as
 * "verified".
 *
 * Paths are resolved against the SEGMENT's effective cwd, which both a leading
 * `cd <dir> &&` and git's `-C <dir>` move. Resolving against the hook's cwd
 * instead made those forms silently unguarded (cave-6d2dp).
 *
 * Deliberate destruction is allowed by prefixing the command with
 * `WT_GUARD_BYPASS=1 ` — the guard only ensures it can't happen by accident.
 * Honoured bypasses AND blocked attempts are appended to
 * `.claude/worktree-guard-bypass.log` (gitignored, one JSON line each with a
 * `verdict` field) so a later post-mortem can tell a deliberate override from
 * a gap in the guard — the question cave-boor8 could not answer. Blocks are
 * recorded too because their absence is itself evidence: a worktree that was
 * never the subject of a block or a bypass yet disappeared was destroyed by
 * something that does not route through the hook at all (external terminal,
 * editor, automation) — the one hole no PreToolUse hook can close.
 * On any internal error the guard exits 0: a hook bug must never brick Bash.

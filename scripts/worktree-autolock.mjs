// Auto-lock worktrees that hold work a removal would destroy.
//
// `git worktree lock` is the only mechanism that survives an actor outside
// Claude Code. `scripts/worktree-guard.mjs` blocks destructive Bash *from a
// Claude session*; it never sees GitHub Desktop, which on 2026-08-03 executed
// 18 `git worktree remove` calls (8 with a single `--force`) and 114 direct
// pushes to `main`. Git refuses to remove a locked worktree unless `--force`
// is given TWICE — Desktop has never escalated past one — so a lock defeats
// every removal actually observed.
//
// Locking by hand is a snapshot: a worktree created a minute later is
// unprotected. This runs as a PreToolUse hook so protection re-applies on its
// own as worktrees appear.
//
// Deliberately does NOT lock clean, fully-pushed worktrees. Removing one of
// those loses nothing (the branch and its commits outlive the worktree), and
// locking it would only force an unlock during routine cleanup. Same
// philosophy as the guard, which lets clean+pushed cleanup pass silently.
//
// Advisory only: this never blocks a tool call and always exits 0.

// cave-7g7py: the hook installer must not disable hooks it does not own.
//
// The failure it guards against: core.hooksPath is a SINGLE directory, so
// pointing it somewhere new silently disables every hook in the old place.
// Clones point it at .beads/hooks, which holds strictly more than
// scripts/git-hooks — beads' lifecycle hooks plus the duplicate-id guard from
// #4231. The installer overwrote it unconditionally, so the script documented
// as the way to activate the duplicate-prevention merge driver removed the
// duplicate-detection hook at the same time.
